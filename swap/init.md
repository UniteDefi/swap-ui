You are building the web application for UniteDefi, a cross-chain swap platform. This needs to be a full-featured, 1inch-style interface.

SETUP TASKS:

1. Refer [@Nextjs.md](Nextjs.md) on how to create and develop files, design patterns and things to follow.
2. Use Reown for auth along with wagmi + viem. Install dependencies accordingly.
3. Setup project structure for professional 1inch like swapping/trading interface
4. Configure for 4 EVM chains: Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum (all are testnets)

IMMEDIATE GOALS:

- Professional swap interface with token selector
- Chain switching functionality
- Dutch auction price display with countdown
- 1inch-style design with Shadcn/Tailwind CSS

Make frequent small commits. Start with Next.js setup and basic component structure.
